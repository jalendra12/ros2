Difference between new int{} and make_shared in smart pointers

Memory Allocation Efficiency:
    new: Allocates memory only for the object. The reference count (for shared_ptr) or other control blocks need to be managed separately.
    make_shared: Allocates memory for both the object and the reference count (control block) in a single, efficient memory block.

Memory Overhead:
    new: If you use new with shared_ptr, there are at least two allocationsâ€”one for the object and one for the control block.
    make_shared: Uses a single memory allocation for both the object and the control block, making it more memory-efficient.
